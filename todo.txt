add game_move_counter that is initialized in set_pos. 
let move_counter be initialized to 0

add last_capture_ind that is reset where fifty_counter is.

draw by rep should use last_capture_ind and move_counter.

drawy by 50 should use fifty_counter.

get rid of gundo_ind -- just use gpos.move_counter

DRY up code in usermove and go

wrap printf.  use a socket descriptor for an fprintf.
create a socket pair for test methods and assert output.

command line param for "random mode"
